TEST SCENARIOS:
- Positive: Fetch all branches successfully
- Positive: Get branch by valid ID
- Positive: Search branches by partial name
- Positive: Create new branch with valid data
- Negative: Get branch with invalid ID (expect 404)
- Negative: Create branch without required fields (expect 400)
- Negative: Create duplicate branch (expect 409)
- Edge Case: Search with special characters
- Edge Case: Update non-existent branch
- Edge Case: Delete already deleted branch

CHAINING:
- Extract branchId from create/get response
- Use branchId in subsequent update/delete operations
- Use branchId for pincode mapping creation
