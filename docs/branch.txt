- Positive: Fetch all branches successfully
- Positive: Get branch by valid ID
- Positive: Search branches by partial name
- Negative: Get branch with invalid ID (expect 404)
- Edge Case: Search with special characters

CHAINING:
- Extract branchId from create/get response
- Use branchId in subsequent update/delete operations

DETAILED CHAINING SPECIFICATION:
- Extract the FIRST branchId and branchName from GET /v1/hub/configurations/branches response
- Save extracted data to JSON file: data/extracted_data.json
- JSON structure: { "branchId": <value>, "branchName": <value> }
- Use extracted values in hub_landing API POST request payload

HUB_LANDING PAYLOAD TEMPLATE:
{
    "basicConfigId": null,
    "branchId": <EXTRACTED_branchId_from_branch_API>,
    "branchName": "<EXTRACTED_branchName_from_branch_API>",
    "startDate": "2025-11-11",
    "endDate": "",
    "basicLkpDraftActive": "SAVE_NEXT",
    "status": true,
    "future": false
}
- Use branchId for pincode mapping creation
